- Hi, Iâ€™m @1blueink.
I've been messing around with building websites for several years now. I started with the good old lamp stack before dabbling into javascript heavy websites. Node was fun. I never got into javascript frameworks.
The web seemed too messy after I delved into webpack and babble. Now I'm playing with Rust. Rust seems complex but straight forward. I look forward to a little wasm and maybe even a little IoT, but Rust guis would be amazing. I'll see if I can handle it!
